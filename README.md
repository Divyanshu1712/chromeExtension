## 🛠️ How Chrome Extensions Work
A Chrome extension consists of the following main components:
- `manifest.json` → Configuration file defining permissions and behavior.
- `popup.html` → The user interface when clicking the extension icon.
- `popup.js` → Handles actions inside the popup.
- `content.js` → Injects JavaScript into webpages to modify or interact with them.
- `background.js` → Runs background tasks (optional).
- `icons/` → Stores extension icons.

These files work together to extend Chrome’s capabilities and allow interaction with web pages.
